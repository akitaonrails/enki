h1. Enki

A Ruby on Rails blogging app for the fashionable developer.

Preferences are for the masses. Any real coder knows the easiest and best way to customize something is by *hacking code*. Because you want your blog to be you, not bog standard install #4958 with 20 posts per page instead of 15. For this you need a *clean, simple, easy to understand code base* that stays out of your way. No liquid drops and templates hindering your path, no ugly PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) stylings burning your eyeballs.

h2. Quick Start

<pre><code>  git clone git://github.com/xaviershay/enki.git enki
  cd enki
  git checkout -b myblog # Create a new work branch
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
  # Edit config/enki.yml and config/database.yml to taste

  # Next step needs libxml2 and libxslt1 and their headers
  # On Debian-based systems: apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
  # On Mac OS X: no action required

  rake db:migrate
  rake spec
  ./script/server
  # Load http://localhost:3000/admin in your browser</code></pre>

Or for bonus points, fork "enki at github":http://github.com/xaviershay/enki/tree/master and clone that instead.

h2. New Features, by AkitaOnRails

* Paperclip for image uploading, because posts deserve some imagery
* Rakismet for spam filtering. Make an account at wordpress.com. Spammers are not welcome here.
* Added support for excerpts in posts, some of us like to write a lot and have leaner index pages.
* Page Caching, because even simple blogs consume a lot nowadays and users deserve faster responses.
* Moving all views to a plugin called 'enki_theme_default'

About the theme, this is still an experimental support. All the views and specs for views were moved to
vendor/plugins/enki_theme_default.

Now, supposedly you will want a prettier theme than the default one. So start off by creating a copy of this
folder to a new one and change your config/environment.rb to have something like this:

<pre><code>config.plugins = [ :enki_theme_foo, :acts_as_taggable_on_steroids, :exception_notification, :formtastic, :make_resourceful, :open_id_authentication, :rakismet ]</code></pre>

This is a list of all the plugins plus your new theme folder, and also ignoring the default theme. The Rails
2.3.x support for Engines allow plugins to override the 'app' folder.

h2. More info

Enki is a compact, easily extendable base for your blog. It does this by being highly opinionated, for example:

* Public facing views should adhere to standards (XHTML(eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language), Atom)
* /yyyy/mm/dd/post-title is a good URL for your posts
* Live comment preview should be provided by default
* Google does search better than you or I
* You don't need a plugin system when you've got decent source control
* If you're not using OpenID you're a chump
* Hacking code is the easiest way to customize something

h2. How it differs from Mephisto

Mephisto is feature packed and quite customizable. It can however be daunting trying to find your way around the code, which isn’t so good if you’re trying to hack in your own features. Enki strips out a lot of the features that you probably don’t need (multiple authors and liquid templates, for example), and focuses on keeping a tight code base that is easy to comprehend and extend.

*If you’re converting from Mephisto,* be sure to have a look at "enki-translator":http://github.com/xaviershay/enki-translator/tree/master

h2. How it differs from SimpleLog

Enki embodies much of the philosophy of SimpleLog, but does so in a style that is much more consistent with Rails best practices, making it easier to understand and hack the code.
